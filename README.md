# React UI Elements

## What Does It Do
* It displays each UI element with a label from a top-down nav on a single page
* This displays an example of what each element looks like

## Motivation
* It gives me a bunch of template UI elements that can be used in future React projects

## Stack
* React
  * Created a modern nav that changes without reloading due to Context
  * Routed multiple components using custom hooks and createContext 
* TailwindCSS
  * Used to style the UI elements in an easy and uniform way 

## Closer Look: Using Presentational Style Components
